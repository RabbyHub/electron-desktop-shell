This repo is forked from [electron-browser-shell] and modified for RabbyHub. We would also contribute the modifications back to the original repo, but for usage in RabbyHub as early as possible, we publish the pre-built result under npm scope `@rabby-wallet`.

Originally, [electron-browser-shell] is under GPL v3 license, we keep it and publish this repository, see more details in [License](#License).

[electron-browser-shell] is a minimal, tabbed web browser with support for Chrome extensions‚Äîbuilt on Electron. We don't rewrite code in [shell](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell/tree/master/packages/shell) nor republish it on our scope, just add some APIs in to [electron-chrome-extensions] and use it in rabby.
